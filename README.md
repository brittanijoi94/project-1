# The Effects of Income Statistics on GDP

## Economic Indicators
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP): This is a consumption indicator that tells us the dollar amount for all the goods and services consumed/completed over a certain period of time.
- Personal Income: An individual’s total earnings and can be generated from multiple avenues. This figure reflects the sum of all salaries, dividends, and social benefits.
- Disposable Income: The amount of revenue made by a person once the necessary taxes on the income has been paid. 
- Per Capita: Average per person. 

## What did we do with this Information? 
- We created a multivariate linear regression formula trying to explain changes in GDP with only using variables we found in the income information.
- A multivariate linear regression model is very similar to the linear regressions we have done in class and follow a similar y=mx+b format. 
  - As the name suggests there are more x variables, so equations looks like this: 
    - Y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + … + b
    - x1, x2, and x3 are independent variables
    - m1, m2, m3 are the respective slopes for each variable 
    - The term b still denotes the y-intercept
